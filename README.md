# MacMemory

This is a simple test program for external memory manipulation on MacOS.

# Usage

I made a compile shell script `./compile.sh` and a run shell script `./run.sh`. 
# Note

You need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to get this working. 
It is not adviced to do so but SIP restricts task for pid.
