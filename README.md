# MacMemory

This is a simple test program for external memory manipulation on MacOS.

# Usage

I made a simple shell script that compiles and runs the example code.
First ensure the script has execute permissions: ` chmod +x run.sh ` 
then you can run the script with: ` ./run.sh `

# Note

You need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to get this working. 
It is not adviced to do so but SIP restricts task for pid.
