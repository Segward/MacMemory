# MacMemory

This is a simple test program for external memory manipulation on MacOS.

# Usage

I made a build shell script that compiles the project into the build folder. <br/>
To give permission to the shell script use `chmod +x build.sh` and to build use `./build.sh`

# Note

You need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to get this working. 
It is not adviced to do so but SIP restricts task for pid.
